# Expresso

## Overview

In this project, I built all of the routing and database logic for a fictional business (restaurant or small cafe).

The Expresso internal tool allows users to:
- Create, view, update, and delete _menus_
- Create, view, update, and delete _menu items_
- Create, view, update, and delete _employees_
- Create, view, update, and delete _employee's timesheets_

Starting code can be found [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/programs/build-apis/projects/capstone-project-2-expresso.zip).

## How To Begin

To start, download the code from the repository. You need Node.js to run this. Run the command `npm install` from the root of this project to make sure you have everything you need to start the project. Run `node server.js` to begin the server code.

To view the site locally, open **index.html** in your web browser of choice. Try
using Chrome if it doesn't appear to work correctly.

## Implementation Details

## Testing

A testing suite has is provided that checks for all essential functionality and
edge cases.

To run these tests, first, open the root project directory in your terminal. Then run `npm install` to install
all necessary testing dependencies (if you haven't already).
Finally, run `npm test`. You will see a list of tests that ran with information
about whether or not each test passed. All should pass currently.
